> A simple desktop application for generating high-quality AI speech from text using Suno's Bark model, featuring a modern dark-themed interface with real-time waveform visualization. Despite the models ability to produce decent sounding audio, the system is not good with continuity or consistent preset selection/seeding.

## Features

- **High-Quality Speech Generation** - Powered by Suno's Bark transformer model
- **Real-Time Waveform Visualization** - See your audio as it's generated
- **Modern Dark UI** - Sleek, professional interface with custom title bar
- **Multiple Voice Presets** - 10+ English voice options to choose from
- **GPU Acceleration** - CUDA support for faster generation
- **Audio Playback Controls** - Built-in player with seek functionality
- **Export to WAV** - Save your generated audio in high quality
- **Sentence Counter** - Track text length with automatic tokenization
- **Adjustable Sample Rate** - Customize audio quality (default 24kHz)
- **Non-Speech Sounds** - Support for laughter, music, sighs, and more

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for faster generation)
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB+ recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dovvnloading/Suno-Bark.git
   cd Suno-Bark
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python echoweave.py
   ```

### Dependencies

```
PySide6>=6.4.0
transformers>=4.30.0
torch>=2.0.0
soundfile>=0.12.0
sounddevice>=0.4.6
pydub>=0.25.1
nltk>=3.8
numpy>=1.24.0
```

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Text** - Type or paste the text you want to convert to speech
2. **Select Voice** - Choose from available English voice presets
3. **Configure Settings** - Adjust sample rate if desired (default: 24000 Hz)
4. **Generate** - Click "Generate Audio" and wait for processing
5. **Preview** - Use the waveform viewer and playback controls
6. **Export** - Save your audio as a WAV file

### Special Text Markers

EchoWeave supports special markers for non-speech sounds:

- `[laughter]` or `[laughs]` - Adds laughter
- `[sighs]` - Adds a sigh
- `[music]` - Adds musical notes
- `[gasps]` - Adds a gasp
- `[clears throat]` - Adds throat clearing


The complete Visual Studio project files and all source code are included in the main repository for easy access and development.

## Interface Components

- **Custom Title Bar** - Frameless window with minimize, maximize, and close buttons
- **Text Editor** - Multi-line input with syntax support for special markers
- **Settings Panel** - Voice selection and sample rate configuration
- **Waveform Viewer** - Real-time audio visualization with playback indicator
- **Seek Slider** - Interactive timeline scrubbing
- **Control Buttons** - Generate, Play/Stop, and Save functionality
- **Status Bar** - Real-time feedback and progress indication

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **ML Model**: Suno Bark (HuggingFace Transformers)
- **Audio Processing**: soundfile, sounddevice, pydub
- **Text Processing**: NLTK for sentence tokenization
- **Visualization**: Custom QPainter-based waveform rendering
- **Threading**: QThread for non-blocking audio generation and playback

## Advanced Configuration

### GPU Memory Optimization

The application automatically enables CPU offloading for CUDA devices to manage memory efficiently. For systems with limited GPU memory, the model uses FP16 precision when available.

### Custom Sample Rates

While 24kHz is recommended, you can adjust the sample rate for different use cases:
- **16kHz** - Lower quality, smaller file sizes
- **24kHz** - Balanced quality and size (default)
- **48kHz** - Higher quality, larger file sizes

## Known Issues

- First-time model loading may take several minutes
- critical: No continuity of presets (the presets for this model do not seem to work)
- GPU memory usage can be high (4GB+ VRAM recommended)
- Long text inputs (50+ sentences) may take significant time to process
